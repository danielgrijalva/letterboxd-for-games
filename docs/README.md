## About

If you use Letterboxd you probably know what this project is about. If not...

**Overworld** is a place where you can share your gaming experiences, keep track of what you play, discover games, manage your backlog, show love to your favorite games, write reviews, compile lists of specific games and _More Stuffâ„¢_.

Follow other people to discuss or discover new games, or you can be a lone wolf and use it as a personal gaming journal.

The project is still in early development. If you have any suggestions, [file an issue](https://github.com/danielgrijalva/overworld/issues/new/choose) or even better, [start contributing](getting-started/contributing.md)!

### Inspiration

Overworld is _heavily_ inspired by [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/), both in functionality, design and the overall user experience.

## Contributing

Head over to the [contribution guidelines](getting-started/contributing.md) for more details.

## Features

> #### [Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielgrijalva/overworld/master/media/demo.gif)

So far you can do the following:

* Create an account
* Log in/out
* Search for games
* View a game's details \(summary, platforms, crew, release date and more\)
* Rate a game on a scale of 1 to 10
* Add a game to your played games
* Add a game to your backlog and/or wish list
* Like a game  

## Desired Features

Here at Overworld, our goal is to continue enabling gamers to share, discover and play the best gaming experiences.

Currently, we are looking to implement the following features:

* An improved rating system, allowing users to rate individual aspects of a game \(gameplay, story, graphics and more\)
* A discovery section, allowing users to find games based on their current likes and ratings
* Additional game information
* Improved compatability with mobile devices

If any of these projects sound interesting to you, feel free to [contribute](getting-started/contributing.md)!
